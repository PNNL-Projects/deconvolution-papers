# deconvolution-papers

A number of algorithms have recently been developed for deconvolution of cell types in bulk RNA-seq samples based on cell type signatures derived from single-cell RNA-seq data. This repository contains a list of recent algorithms and application papers, along with our comments on them.

The list is organized into two parts: (i) method papers describing new algorithms, and (ii) application papers. The list will be added to over time.
